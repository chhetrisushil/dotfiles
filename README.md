dotfiles
========
This repo is just to store my dot config files for example .vimrc etc

reference: https://github.com/sagarrakshe/dotvim, https://github.com/sagarrakshe/dotfiles

**NOTE:** locaiton of most of the config is HOME directory (i.e. ~/) except for .gitconfig which resides in the project directory
