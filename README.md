This repo is just to store my dot config files for example .vimrc etc

install alock from https://github.com/chhetrisushil/alock

**NOTES:** 
  - location of most of the config is HOME directory (i.e. ~/) except for .gitconfig which resides in the project directory
  - Create a ".tags" folder in home directory
  - Run npm install after installing tern plugin
  - Run git submodule update --init --recursive in vim-jsbeautify plugin folder
